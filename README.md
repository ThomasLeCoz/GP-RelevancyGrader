# Guest Post Relevancy Grader

RGA â€” Relevancy Grader Assistant is a script that helps with grading guest posts opportunities.

Basically, it scrapes the number of pages in the index of Google for very specific search phrases, allowing us to determine the relevancy of a website by analyzing the ratio of the number of pages correlated to a search term to the total number of pages in the index of Google.

It's very gentle with Google and tries to be as natural as possible to avoid triggering the numerous protections in place.
